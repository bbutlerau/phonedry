All notable changes to Phonedry are recorded here. Versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project scaffold: module manifest, licence, and release workflow.
- Boot path: forces Foundry's `noCanvas` mode on mobile clients so PIXI and the
  scene canvas are never initialised, and replaces the core tabletop UI
  applications with non-rendering subclasses so they are never built.
- Full-screen shell application, rendered in place of the tabletop.
- `viewport-fit=cover` is appended to Foundry's viewport meta so CSS safe-area
  insets report real values on notched and cutout displays.
- Client setting to force the mobile client on or off, overriding detection.
